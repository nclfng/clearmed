ClearMed — starter evaluation harness.

Build this out in Week 1-2, BEFORE the agents. You can't improve what you can't measure.
Run: python -m clearmed.eval_harness  (expects data/medaesqa_v1.json — see data/README.md)

Provides:
  - readability_scores(text): Flesch-Kincaid grade, SMOG, jargon density, length
  - meets_readability_target(text): the <= 8th-grade success criterion
  - load_medaesqa(path): loads the gold eval set
  - verifier_agreement(human, verifier): accuracy + Cohen's kappa for Verifier calibration

This is model-agnostic — it scores text, whatever produced it. Extend, don't treat as final.
Each agent owner plugs their agent's outputs into this harness.
